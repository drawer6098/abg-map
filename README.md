# abg-map
This is a REALLY fucking stupid bit. Pretty much every single line of code here I did not write because I don't know HTML, JS, or CSS at all. It's pretty funny though, so that's a win.

Basically, this is just a map of the counties within the fifty United States that are color-coded based on census data of how many Asian women live there. Or in other words, a map of ABG population density.

This is all BK's fault.
